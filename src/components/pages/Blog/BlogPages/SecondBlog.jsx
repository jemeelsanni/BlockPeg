              Cryptocurrency trading is known for its extreme volatility, which
              can be challenging even for experienced traders. For amateurs,
              this extreme volatility poses a more significant challenge. <br />
              <br />
              On the other hand, volatility is why many love investing in
              cryptocurrency, as they believe they can make quick profits. To be
              profitable in a volatile market, traders need to possess some key
              analytical skills, such as Technical Analysis, Fundamental
              analysis, and Sentiment Analysis. <br />
              <br />
              These forms of analysis can be so complicated that even experts
              don’t always win the market; how much more amateurs? <br />
              <br />
              The risk of losses due to volatility can be heightened because
              many amateur traders are unfamiliar with the nuances of trading
              and cannot assess the market accurately. <br />
              <br />
              Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile compared to other
              investment instruments, so much so that one can get wrecked in
              minutes, which happens often. On the bright side, one can also
              make a lot of money in the shortest possible time. <br />
              <br />
              As much as making a lot of money is possible, the odds are not in
              your favour as an amateur.

              To succeed as a crypto trader can be difficult when you lack the
              technical know-how to navigate the market. <br />
              <br />
              As an amateur, you are prone to make many bad decisions, which can
              result in significant loss. <br />
              <br />
              Traders who lack expertise are prone to Emotional Trading. This
              happens when traders make impulsive decisions based on emotions
              rather than logic, leading to poor investment decisions such as
              FOMO, Panic-Selling, etc.
              <br />
              <br />
              Greed and Fear are the key drivers of emotional trading; these are
              familiar demons that most traders face in the market. As an
              amateur, you’d hardly be able to control these emotions.

              SECURITY RISKS
            </h5>
            <p className="body text-xl">
              Cryptocurrency trading can be risky due to the high potential for
              security breach. Amateur traders are usually unaware of the risks
              associated with trading and may not be familiar with the security
              protocols that must be followed. This can lead to losses due to
              bad decisions or malicious activities.
              <br />
              <br />
              For instance, if you forget your private keys, your coins could be
              lost forever. If you expose them unknowingly, someone else can
              easily steal your coins.
              <br />
              <br />
              Other complex security breaches such as social engineering,
              dusting attacks, and phishing can also be used to steal
              cryptocurrencies, especially from amateurs who don’t know how
              these things work.
              <br />
              <br />
              Another instance can be when you invest in scam projects designed
              to Rug all the investors. As an amateur, it’s difficult to tell
              which project is legitimate and which is not. Amateur traders are
              more susceptible to experiencing a RUG-PULL.

              From the above, every crypto trader who wishes to become

              cryptocurrency works and how price movement can impact him if he’s
              invested in any cryptocurrency.
              <br />
              <br />
              The importance of education cannot be overemphasized, as the risk
